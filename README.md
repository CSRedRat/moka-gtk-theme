###Using the Source

There are scripts to simplify the rendering process; to run them (and edit the GTK assets) you will need:

 * inkscape
 * ruby
 * python3

To render new or modified assets from their source SVG files, run the following to render the respective assets

    ./render-gtk3-assets.py     	# GTK3 assets
    ./render-metacity-assets.py 	# Metacity assets
    ./render-unity-assets.py    	# Unity assets

This script will look in the source directories (../src/*) and render the respective assets (provided there are changes).
